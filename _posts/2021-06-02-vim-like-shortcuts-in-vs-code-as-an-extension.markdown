title: "Vim-like Shortcuts in VS Code; Now as An Extension"
date: 2021-06-02 13:20:00 +0330
excerpt: |
    Vim and VS Code are both great super text editors with their unique
    features. Although the superb keyboard shortcuts of Vim are missing in VS
    Code, but it's still possible to have basic of them working there using this
    new VS Code extension.

In a recent [blog post][blog-post], I talked about my way of overriding some keyboard shortcuts to kind of resemble those of VIM which we like the most. Now, to make it easier for you to test drive it, I've made this VS Code extension, *Semi-Vim Shortcuts*, which you can find and install from [here][extension]. üèá

In VS Code, aside from the *Extensions* view (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>x</kbd>), you can install the extension by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>p</kbd> and entering this in the command bar:

```
ext install babakks.vscode-vim-shortcuts
```

Hope to hear your thoughts and feedbacks. ü•≥
