It's not that unusual to need to see/check/verify the binary output of a shell command in HEX format. Clearly, I mean without picking up a HEX editor or something like that. Last time, it happened to me a few days ago when I was to inspect the content of a base64-encoded string. The tool to the rescue is (of course not limited to) `xxd`. üèÖ

Using `xxd`, to get the HEX representation for some binary content you just need to call it with no argument:

```sh
echo -n 'Computer says: "Hello World!"' | xxd
```

Depending on the case it could be more insightful to also have the ASCII values column. That's simply done by calling `xxd` with `-C` option:

```sh
echo -n 'Computer says: "Hello World!"' | xxd -C
```

Which results in such a neat output:

```text
00000000: 436f 6d70 7574 6572 2073 6179 733a 2022  Computer says: "
00000010: 4865 6c6c 6f20 576f 726c 6421 22         Hello World!"
```

Also, `xxd` can do things the other way. For instance, may you need to turn a HEX string into a binary content, just call `xxd` with `-r` option, like this:

```sh
echo -n "0x48656c6c6f20576f726c6421" | xxd -r
```

Which would result in:

```text
Hello World!
```

There are more `xxd` options which you can find by checking:

```sh
xxd --help
```

or

```sh
man xxd
```
