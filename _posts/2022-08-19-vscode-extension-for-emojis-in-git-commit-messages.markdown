## Emoji in git commit message

If you're VS Code user and also a fan of emojis, this new VS Code extension might appeal to you, especially if you've read and liked [*Emojis for Better Git Commit Messages*][emojis-post] for its exhaustive table of contextual emoji data which were gathered over years. This new extension is called **Git-Emoji**. What it does is to provide you with relevant emoji suggestions to add to your git commit messages. This short screen capture would show you how this extension works:
