    There are times when you just need to perform string manipulation (e.g., string replace) via the shell, and it's not that uncommon, if you think that way.

Though 99% of the time we use a text editor like `vim` or `nano`, still knowing how to do simple string manipulations via shell commands is more than necessary. The simplest use case emerges in CI/CD pipeline where you may need to replace some placeholder with a specific text (e.g., a dynamic docker image tag). ü§ñ

One simple tool for this purpose is `sed`. For example, to replace "[tag]" with "abcdef" execute:

```sh
echo "docker push -t app:[tag]" | sed -e 's/[tag]/abcdef/g'
```

You can also use `sed` just like `grep` and pass a file to be used as the input stream:

```sh
sed -e 's/[tag]/abcdef/g' input-file.txt
```

You may add more expressions by adding any number of `-e expression` arguments:

```sh
sed -e 's/[tag]/abcdef/g' -e 's/[image]/app/g' input-file.txt
```
