## `rm` ðŸ’£

Removes files or directories.

ðŸ’€ Removal is irreversible.

```

## Remove multiple files

```

## Remove a directory `-r`

```sh
rm -r my-dir
```

## Set to prompt before every removal `-i`

```sh
rm -ri my-dir
```

## Set to suppress any interaction/error `-f`

```sh
rm -rf my-dir my-non-existing-dir
```
