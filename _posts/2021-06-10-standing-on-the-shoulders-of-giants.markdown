Have you ever heard words like below?

- "We'd better off not using design patterns."
- "Design patterns introduce *complexity* and we want to keep things simple."
- "Those patterns are just for *huge codebases*."

Undoubtedly, the more experienced a developer is, the more knowledge on design patterns/anti-patterns, common pitfalls, and best practices they posses. So, you can weigh the technical superiority of a company/team/developer with their appreciation for [*standing on the shoulders of giants.*][standing]

So, if your answer was positive, recalibrate your technical expectations from your current workplace.
